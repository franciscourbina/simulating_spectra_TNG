The following codes uses TRIDENT simulate mock observations of cosmological simulations such as TNG50. 
You can easily create observations of galaxies (subhalos) at any desired inclination and then perform some easy analysis into the data, such as extrating equilavent width maps, kinematics analysis, etc.
